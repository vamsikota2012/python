What is virtual environment?

A virtual environment is a private copy of the Python interpreter onto which you can install packages privately, 
without affecting the global Python interpreter installed in the system.

Virtual environments are very useful because they prevent package clutter and version conflicts in the system’s Python interpreter. 
Creating a virtual environment for each application ensures that applications have access to only the packages that they use,
while the global interpreter remains neat and clean and serves only as a source from which more virtual environments can be created. 
As an added benefit, virtual environments don’t require administrator rights.

command to create virtual environment.
python3 -m venv c:/users/sravanthikota1/my_env
activate virtual environment.
source my_env/bin/activate

When a virtual environment is activated, the location of its Python interpreter is added to the PATH, 
but this change is not permanent; it affects only your current command session.
When you are done working with the virtual environment and want to return to the global Python interpreter, type deactivate at the command prompt.
