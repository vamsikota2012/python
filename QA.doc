What is virtual environment?

A virtual environment is a private copy of the Python interpreter onto which you can install packages privately, 
without affecting the global Python interpreter installed in the system.

Virtual environments are very useful because they prevent package clutter and version conflicts in the system’s Python interpreter. 
Creating a virtual environment for each application ensures that applications have access to only the packages that they use,
while the global interpreter remains neat and clean and serves only as a source from which more virtual environments can be created. 
As an added benefit, virtual environments don’t require administrator rights.
