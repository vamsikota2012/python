----------------------------------------------------------------------------What is virtual environment?------------------------------------

A virtual environment is a private copy of the Python interpreter onto which you can install packages privately, 
without affecting the global Python interpreter installed in the system.

Virtual environments are very useful because they prevent package clutter and version conflicts in the system’s Python interpreter. 
Creating a virtual environment for each application ensures that applications have access to only the packages that they use,
while the global interpreter remains neat and clean and serves only as a source from which more virtual environments can be created. 
As an added benefit, virtual environments don’t require administrator rights.

command to create virtual environment.
python3 -m venv c:/users/sravanthikota1/my_env
activate virtual environment.
source my_env/bin/activate

When a virtual environment is activated, the location of its Python interpreter is added to the PATH, 
but this change is not permanent; it affects only your current command session.
When you are done working with the virtual environment and want to return to the global Python interpreter, type deactivate at the command prompt.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------What is PIP?------------------------------------
PIP is a package manager for Python packages. to install and uninstall packages on python interpreter.

pip --version ********* check pip version
pip install <package_name> ********* to install package 
pip uninstall <package_name> ********* to uninstall package
pip list ********* to list installed packages.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------What is the difference between py and pyc files in Python?------------------------------------
.py files contain the source code of a program. Whereas, .pyc file contains the bytecode of your program. 
We get bytecode after compilation of .py file (source code). .pyc files are not created for all the files that you run. 
It is only created for the files that you import.

Before executing a python program python interpreter checks for the compiled files. 
If the file is present, the virtual machine executes it. If not found, it checks for .py file. If found, compiles it to .pyc file 
and then python virtual machine executes it.

Having .pyc file saves you the compilation time.
